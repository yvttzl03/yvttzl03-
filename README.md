# 👋 Hi, I'm Yvette!

I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student from Spain.
I mainly work with **Java** and I'm currently learning **Python** on my own.
I use **Visual Studio Code**, **GitHub**, and **Eclipse** for my projects.

I started from zero programming knowledge, and I'm giving my best every day to learn, improve, and build a strong foundation in software development.

##  About Me
-  Always curious and eager to learn new technologies
-  Enjoy solving problems and understanding how things work
-  Open to collaborating and sharing what I learn along the way

##  Current Goals
- Strengthen my programming skills in Java and Python
- Build personal and university projects to practice what I learn
- Develop good coding habits and a professional GitHub portfolio
